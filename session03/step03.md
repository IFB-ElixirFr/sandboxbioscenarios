### *head*

You might sometimes want to check just the beginning of a file.
That is what the `head` command does:

```bash
head belebele.bed
```

By default, this command will show you the first 10 lines of a file. 

You can modulate the number of lines shown with the option _-n_:

```
head -n 15 belebele.bed
``` 

will show you the first 15 lines.


>> Print the first line of the belebele.bed file. What is the fisrt value of the third column ? Choose the right answer: <<
( ) 1878
(*) 2821361
( ) 3289
( ) 6968
