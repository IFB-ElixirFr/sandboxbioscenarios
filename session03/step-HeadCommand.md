### *head*

You might sometimes want to check just the beginning of a file.
The `head` command is made for that:

`head peekaboo.bed`

By default, that command will show you the first 10 lines of a file. 

You can modulate the number of lines shown with the option _-n_:

`head -n 15 peekaboo.bed` 

will show you the first 15 lines.
