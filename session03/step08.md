## Some useful commands and tips

- `history` shows all the commands you used so far. An incrementing number is attributed to each of them.

- `!num` where *num* is the command number in history: runs again the corresponding command.

- You can also use up-arrow to get the previous (unexecuted) command back and you can change it as you need.
