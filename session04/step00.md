Welcome!

During this courses, we will learn how to combine some bash commands.

The left panel will contain the explanations and guides to run command lines. Use the right panel to type the command examples and experiment as you want.

During the course, some bash instructions will be explained. They will be written like `this` and must be copied in the right window. Their text or value can be modified if you wish, but in order to answer questions or quizzes, we advise you to copy the proposed instructions exactly as they are.
