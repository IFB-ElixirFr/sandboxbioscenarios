## Create directory

The `mkdir` command (**m**a**k**e **dir**ectory) creates a new directory whose name is given as argument.

Use the `mkdir` command to create a repository `my_dir` in your HOME directory. To do so, first go to your HOME with the `cd` command, create the directory with the `mkdir` command, and see the result with the `tree` command:

```bash
cd
tree
mkdir my_dir
tree
```

Still from your HOME directory, create another directory nammed `my_dir2` into the directory `/shared/data/tutorials/linux_basics_session02/projects/facts/`. 
Use the command `tree` to display the file and directory organisation from the directory `/shared/data/tutorials/linux_basics_session02/project/facts`. Reminder: be lazy and use the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key to speed up your writing of the path.

```bash
cd
mkdir /shared/data/tutorials/linux_basics_session02/projects/facts/my_dir2
tree /shared/data/tutorials/linux_basics_session02/projects/facts
```

## Copying files and directories

The `cp` (**c**o**p**y) command copies files or directories. It takes 2 paths as argument:

```bash
cp <source_path> <destination_path>
```

Example: go to the `~/test` directory and duplicate the file named `first_file.txt` while changing its name to `third_file.txt`:

```bash
cd ~/test
cp first_file.txt third_file.txt
ls 
```

With the option `-r` (**r**ecursive), the `cp` command copies all files of the source directory to the destination directory.

Try to copy the `~/test` repository and its content to a new directory named `my_test` in the directory `/shared/data/tutorials/linux_basics_session02/projects/facts/`:

```bash
tree /shared/projects/facts
cp -r ~/test /shared/data/tutorials/linux_basics_session02/projects/facts/my_test
tree /shared/data/tutorials/linux_basics_session02/projects/facts
```
