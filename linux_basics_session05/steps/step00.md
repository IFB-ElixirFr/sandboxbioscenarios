Welcome!

In this course, our goal is to explore how to use a bioinformatics tool.

The left panel will provide explanations and step-by-step guides. Use the right panel to try out the instructions and experiment freely.

Throughout the course, we will introduce some commands, which will be presented in `this` format. You can copy these commands into the right panel as they are or modify them if needed. However, for answering questions or completing quizzes, we recommend using the exact instructions as provided.
