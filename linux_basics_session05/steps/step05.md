##Â Calculating nucleotide composition statistics with seqkit

The `seqkit fx2tab` command converts a FASTA or FASTQ file (either compress of uncompressed) into a tabulated format (*i.e* multi-column format). By default, the first column contains the sequence identifier (i.e., the FASTA header), while the second holds the sequence itself.
A key advantage of using a tabulated format is the ability to include additional columns with extra information. The `seqkit fx2tab` command offers various options to append statistics such as GC content, nucleotide composition, or average base quality (for FASTQ files).

Check the documentation for `seqkit fx2tab`using the following instruction:

```bash
seqkit fx2tab -h
```

You'll find several useful arguments that can be combined to obtain a comprehensive overview of nucleotide composition in chromosome sequences. For example, the following options can be used to build our call to `seqkit fx2tab`.

- `-n`: Displays only the sequence name, omitting the full sequence (which can be very long).
- `-B/--base-content`: Calculates the percentage of a specified nucleotide or set of nucleotides. For example, in eukaryotic sequences, GC content (percentage of G or C) is commonly analyzed due to its functional significance.
- `-l/--length`: Computes the length of each sequence. Unlike `seqkit stats`, which provides average statistics, this option outputs the length for each individual sequence.
- `-H/--header-line`: Adds an initial header line with column names for better readability.

We can then call `seqkit fx2tab` using these options and providing the `sacCer3.fa.gz` as last argument:

```bash
seqkit fx2tab -H -n -l -B A,C,T,G,GC /shared/bank/saccharomyces_cerevisiae/SacCer3/fasta/sacCer3.fa.gz
```
